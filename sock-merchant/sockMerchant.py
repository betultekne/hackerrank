# Problem Definiton: John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. 
# Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
# I have solved this problem by simply changing the first one of the pair to 0.
